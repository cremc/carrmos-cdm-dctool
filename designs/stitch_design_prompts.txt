Please changes the example content given in the UI designs to reflect the above domains for a career planning and solutions provider.









In this page, the following changes are suggested:
    The page header is missing. Add the page title "Data Review" somewhere in the top portion of the page below the title bar.
    The left panel which provides access to the domains, tables and their columns, has three level of hierarchy. The top level is Domain level that you have shown (Academics, Career, Institution and so on) is correct. When a Domain is expanded, you get all the tables under it. For example, under Academics domain, the following tables should show (in the given order):
academic_level
stream
discipline_group
discipline
course_general
core_subject
entrance_test
course_general_core_subject
course_general_discipline

    The example dataset is not correct, and is misleading. Currently in this application we are not storing or reviewing users/students data.

------------

The page header size and style is not consistent with the size and style of other pages. Please increase the font weight.
All the domains are not showing, only two domains are showing: Academic Paths and Institution. Here is the full list of domains that need to show.

Academics paths
Career
Institution
Course
Requirements
General
Finance
Multi-domain

Each table under the domains should also be collapsible and expandable, to reveal the columns in it. Each column name is preceded by a check box. In the design we need to show the academic_level table expanded, with its columns displayed. User can select multiple columns in multiple tables to display at once. For our example, we need to show the following tables under academic_level table:

academic_level_id (PK)
name*
description*
min_years_to_complete
average_years_to_complete*
max_years_to_complete
prerequisite_academic_level_ID
order*

The Join On and Group By features should appear below the search box.
The columns marked with an *, should be shown as selected in the left panel, and should be displayed in the middle panel and right side panel.

-------------

Make the following changes in this page:

The button on bottom right corner should be labeled as Edit Mode.

As you have done in other pages, add horizontal menu in the main title bar. Add the following:

Dashboard Data Review (highlighted) Data QC Data Relate

In the top of the left panel, just below the header DATA DISCTIONARY, replace the text "Academic Domain Schema" to "Db: Qued_India_Staging"

------------

Ensure that all the pages, including the dashboard and excluding the log-in page, have the same nav bar look and feel as in the latest Data Review page: Horizontal menu, and on extreme right Help icon, settings icon and user icon.

------------

In this form, make the page header style and placement consistent with the latest Data Review page.

In the left hand panel show the list of Domains (as shown in the Data Review page). Each domain when expanded reveals the tables under it. In this form show the Career domain in expanded and display the following table names under it.

industry_sector
industry
industry_branch
career_position
skill_category
skill_subcategory
score_reference
skill_subcategory_career_position

Show the career_position as selected.

-----------------

In the left side panel, for each table add a push icon so that the user knows that this table can be pushed to the middle panel.

The middle panel needs to have the following layout:
This panel will be divided into two horizontal panels occupying the middle panel in roughly 35:75 ratio. 
The top part of the panel (the top horizontal panel having 35% area) will be occupied by the table that has been pushed from the left panel.
